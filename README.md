# ROSAR: Robust Sonar Adversarial Re-training

ROSAR is a novel framework enhancing the robustness of deep learning object detection models tailored for side-scan sonar (SSS) images, generated by autonomous underwater vehicles using sonar sensors. By extending our [prior work on knowledge distillation (KD)](https://github.com/remaro-network/KD-YOLOX-ViT), this framework integrates KD with adversarial retraining to address the dual challenges of model efficiency and robustness against SSS noises. 

We introduce three novel, [publicly available SSS datasets](https://zenodo.org/records/13692547), capturing different sonar setups and noise conditions. We propose and formalize two SSS safety properties and utilize them to generate adversarial datasets for retraining. Through a comparative analysis of projected gradient descent (PGD) and patch-based adversarial attacks, ROSAR demonstrates significant improvements in model robustness and detection accuracy under SSS-specific conditions, enhancing the model's robustness by up to 1.85%.

## Setup (tested under Ubuntu 20.04)

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/remaro-network/ROSAR-framework.git`

2. Setup conda environment:
```
# Change current working directory to ROSAR repository
cd ROSAR-framework

# Remove the old environment, if necessary.
conda deactivate; conda env remove --name ROSAR-framework

# install all dependents into the alpha-beta-crown environment
conda env create -f alpha-beta-CROWN/complete_verifier/environment.yaml --name ROSAR-framework

# activate the environment
conda activate ROSAR-framework
```

## Example usage

1. Generate robustness property
```
# Assuming that the current working directory is the main directory of ROSAR
python generate_P1.py ./data/Compressed_SSS400.png 0 0.10
```

2. Copy the safety property into the alpha-beta-CROWN tool
```
# Copy the instances.csv file
cp instances.csv ./alpha-beta-CROWN/complete_verifier/models/yolox/

# Copy the vnnlib file
cp ./vnnlib/Compressed_SSS400_perturbed_bbox_0_delta_0.1.vnnlib ./alpha-beta-CROWN/complete_verifier/models/yolox/vnnlib/
```
3. Run the tool
```
# Change directory and run the tool
cd alpha-beta-CROWN/complete_verifier
python abcrown.py --device cpu --config exp_configs/yolox/yolox.yaml --show_adv_example
```

(optional) 4. Generate other property
```
# Assuming that the current working directory is the main directory of ROSAR
python generate_P2.py ./data/Compressed_SSS400.png 0 0.25
```

(optional) 5. Copy the safety property into the tool
```
# Copy the instances.csv file
cp instances.csv ./alpha-beta-CROWN/complete_verifier/models/yolox/

# Copy the vnnlib file
cp vnnlib/img_Compressed_SSS400_black_lines_0_min_delta_0.25.vnnlib alpha-beta-CROWN/complete_verifier/models/yolox/vnnlib/
```

(optional) 6. Run the tool
```
cd alpha-beta-CROWN/complete_verifier
python abcrown.py --device cpu --config exp_configs/yolox/yolox.yaml --show_adv_example
```
